# Documentation project instructions

## About this project

- This is a documentation site built on [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com)
- Pages are MDX files with YAML frontmatter
- Configuration lives in `docs.json`
- Use the Mintlify MCP server, `https://mcp.mintlify.com`, to edit content and settings via MCP
- Use the Mintlify docs MCP server, `https://www.mintlify.com/docs/mcp`, to query information about using Mintlify via MCP

## Local preview

- MDX pages live at the repo **root** (not in a `docs/` subfolder) — `navigation.pages` paths in `docs.json` resolve relative to the root.
- Mintlify CLI rejects Node 25+. This machine has Node 26, so run the preview under Node 22:

```bash
npx --yes node@22 <path-to-mintlify>/index.js dev
```

- The Mintlify package is cached by npx under `~/.npm/_npx/*/node_modules/mintlify/`.

## Terminology

{/* Add product-specific terms and preferred usage */}
{/* Example: Use "workspace" not "project", "member" not "user" */}
